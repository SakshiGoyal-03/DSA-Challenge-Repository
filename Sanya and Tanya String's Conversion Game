Sanya and Tanya

Problem Statement: 

Sanya and Tanya, twin sisters were playing a game where one person guesses a string 'str1' and the other guesses another string 'str2' of the same length to see how they both differ from
each other mentally, since they are both so similar physically.
After they played this game a few times Tanya proposed they try to see how easily their strings can be converted to one another, so they took a integer called maxCost and decided that the 
cost of transforming the ith character of 'str1' to the ith character of 'str2' is equal to the absolute value of their difference in ascii values.

Your task is to help them in playing their game by telling them the maximum length of a substring that can be converted from 'str1' to 'str2' with the total cost of their transformations
less than or equal to maxCost. If you can't find any possible transformation just tell them the length is 0.

Solution : 

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;


        public class Solution{
       
       public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        while (t-- > 0) {
            String str1 = sc.next();
            String str2 = sc.next();
            int maxCost = sc.nextInt();
            int n = str1.length();
            int[] diff = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                diff[i] = Math.abs(str1.charAt(i) - str2.charAt(i));
            }
            int l = 0, r = 0, cost = 0, ans = 0;
            while (r < n) {
                cost += diff[r];
                while (cost > maxCost) {
                    cost -= diff[l];
                    l++;
                }
                ans = Math.max(ans, r - l + 1);
                r++;
            }
            System.out.println(ans);
        }
    }
}
